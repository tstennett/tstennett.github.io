    <h1>Tyler Stennett - Work Record</h1>
    <p>This is the various activities I have finished, and how it can be applied to my project. Please note that at the current time, I do not plan to directly use JSON files, meaning that Activity 2 may not be necessarily used.</p>

        <td>In this stage, we created the file for the photos to be used. This is relevant to my project as I will have to display photos beside my content and on my flip-boxes, and will use the same setup procedure to ensure that it functions properly.</td>

        </td>
        <td>In this stage, we developped the first flip-box. We used CSS to edit the attributes of the box, such as the border, the font, and the background colour. This is fundamental to my program as I will need to create flip-boxes with specific images.</td>

      </form>

        </td>
        <td>Within Stage 3, we duplicated our code to make a variety of flip-boxes. This is applicable to my project as I will need to create around three flip-boxes for my last page.</td>

      </form>

        </td>
        <td>Within this stage, we made the title fixed on the screen. This was done by utilizing CSS, and the "position:fixed" line. This can be applicable to my project if I was to set the title as fixed, although I have currently decided to not.</td>

        <td>In this stage, we first the "console.log" to access information from the JSON, and then we sifted through the files to locate Canada's statistics. The primary take-away from this stage for my project is the use of "console.log", and the ability to sift through JSON files.</td>

        <td>In this stage, after learning the "for loop", we were capable of displaying all the data from the JSON file. The key take-aways for my project is the ability to use for loops, which is a skill that may be useful. Otherwise, I do not plan to display all the data from a JSON file at once.</td>

        <td>Branching off the work of the previous stage, in this stage, we would change the colours of the different bars, so they are not just one singular colour. Again, due to my uninterest in the use of a total JSON file, I will not need to incorporate this program.</td>

        <td>Again utilizing "w3schools", I created a sample animated button, which I will use as framework for my text size change button. The primary difference between that and the button I envisioned is that I would use images. The first image would be a letter in small text, encased in a circle, whereas once clicked, the image would change to a letter in large text. Of course, the font would change accordingly.</td>
